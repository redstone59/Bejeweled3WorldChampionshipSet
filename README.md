# Bejeweled 3 World Championships
A Python application that latches onto Bejeweled 3's memory addresses* to create a Nintendo World Championships type challenge.

*This is the reason I call the program a 'parasite', as it isn't a mod of the game.

This repository contains the actual parasite and a tkinter GUI to create challenges.
Users will have to install the [ReadWriteMemory](https://pypi.org/project/ReadWriteMemory/) module and the [psutil](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/)
module.

The repository does not include the proper version of the game required (namely, the one called `popcapgame1.exe`). This is the most common version of the unmodified game.
